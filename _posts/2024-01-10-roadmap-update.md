### What's the goal?
The CompTIA trifecta: A+, Network+, and Security+

### How much will it cost?
A+ 1101 Basic Bundle: $359
A+ 1102 Basic Bundle: $359

Network+ Basic Bundle: $462

Security+ Basic Bundle: $565

Total exam cost: $1,745USD ($2,335CAD)

Essentially it's four exams for three certifications.

### How long will it take?
Ideally I would get all three certifications before the end of 2024.

CertUp (see link below) suggests that the A+ exam will take sixty hours of preparation.
