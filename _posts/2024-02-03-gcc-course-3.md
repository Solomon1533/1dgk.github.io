title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course 3 - Connect and Protect - Networks and Network Security
---
This is the third course of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course on Coursera. Again it's a mix of my notes and definitions from the course.

[Here is a link to my main page for the course.](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/24/gcc-course-index.html)

**Course 3 Overview**

## Module 1: Network architecture
- Structure of a network
- Network operations
- Network attacks
- Security hardening

### Introduction to networks
- Structure of a network
- Standard networking tools
- Cloud networks
- TCP/IP model

**Network**: A group of connected devices.

**Local Area Network (LAN)**: A network that spans a small area like an office building, a school, or a home. 

**Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A network that spans a large geographic area like a city, state, or country. The internet is like a giant WAN.

**Network tools**

**Hub**: A network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network.

**Switch**: A device that makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them. 

**Router**: A network device that connects multiple networks together. 

**Modem**: A device that connects your router to the internet and brings internet access to the LAN.

**Virtualization tools**: Pieces of software that perform network operations. 

**Cloud networks**

**Cloud computing**: The practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices. 

**Cloud network**: A collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in remote data centers that can be accessed via the internet. 

**Cloud service providers (CSPs) offer**
- On-demand storage
- Processing power
- Analytics

**Three main categories of services**
- Software as a service (SaaS) 
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- Platform as a service (PaaS)

**Benefits of cloud computing and software-defined networks**
- Reliability
- Cost
- Scalability

### Network communication
**Data packet**: A basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network. 

E.g. the packet header includes information like the sender's IP address, the destination's MAC address, and the protocol to use.

**Bandwidth**: The amount of data a device receives every second.

**Speed**: The rate at which data packets are received or downloaded.

**Packet sniffing**: The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network. 

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: An internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data. 

**Internet Protocol (IP)**: A set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on a network.

**Port**: A software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network.

**Port numbers**
- Port 25 - Email
- Port 443 - Secure internet communication
- Port 20 - Large file transfers

**TCP/IP model**: A framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across the network.

**Four layers of the TCP/IP model**
- Network access layer. Creation of data packets. (Ethernet, WLAN)
- Internet layer. IP addresses are attached to data packets. (IP v4, v6)
- Transport layer. Protocols to control the flow of traffic. (TCP, UDP)
- Application layer. How data packets will interact with receiving devices. (HTTP, TLS, DNS)

**Open systems interconnection (OSI) model**: A standardized concept that describes the seven layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network.
- Physical 
- Data
- Network
- Transport
- Session
- Presentation
- Application

**Internet Protocol (IP) address**: A unique string of characters that identifies the location of a device on the internet

**User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: A connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before transmissions
