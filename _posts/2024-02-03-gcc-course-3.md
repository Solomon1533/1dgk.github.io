---
This is the third course of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course on Coursera. Again it's a mix of my notes and definitions from the course.

[Here is a link to my main page for the course.](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/24/gcc-course-index.html)

**Course 3 Overview**


## Module 1: Network architecture
- Structure of a network
- Network operations
- Network attacks
- Security hardening

### Introduction to networks
- Structure of a network
- Standard networking tools
- Cloud networks
- TCP/IP model

**Network**: A group of connected devices.

**Local Area Network (LAN)**: A network that spans a small area like an office building, a school, or a home. 

**Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A network that spans a large geographic area like a city, state, or country. The internet is like a giant WAN.

**Network tools**

**Hub**: A network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network.

**Switch**: A device that makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them. 

**Router**: A network device that connects multiple networks together. 

**Modem**: A device that connects your router to the internet and brings internet access to the LAN.

**Virtualization tools**: Pieces of software that perform network operations. 

**Cloud networks**

**Cloud computing**: The practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices. 

**Cloud network**: A collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in remote data centers that can be accessed via the internet. 

**Cloud service providers (CSPs) offer**
- On-demand storage
- Processing power
- Analytics

**Three main categories of services**
- Software as a service (SaaS) 
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- Platform as a service (PaaS)

**Benefits of cloud computing and software-defined networks**
- Reliability
- Cost
- Scalability
