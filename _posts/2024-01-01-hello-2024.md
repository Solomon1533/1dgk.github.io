I set up syncthing on my laptop.
Some questions:    
- Should I use https? I think so. The question is, how often will I need to sync from outside the house? Usually I turn off my desktop computer when I leave. 
- What about username and password, which they call gui authentication? It's related to the above. If I don't need to sync when I'm outside of my home network, then what's the point?

I downloaded the [markdown guide from matt cone](https://www.markdownguide.org/). It's a great website and the book is freely available under creative commons.

I learned that if you add '&' after a command in bash, it will run the program in the background. So it will be useful when I run syncthing, because currently it needs the terminal window to run.

Everything in Linux is more complicated (to me, anyway), but that's part of the beauty of it. For most things, you can take a peek under the hood and see how everything works.

A mod on the tryhackme subreddit said that [80% of the content is free rooms](https://www.reddit.com/r/tryhackme/comments/18d6fkl/comment/kcmbyfu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
They also said that [the vouchers dont expire](https://www.reddit.com/r/tryhackme/comments/10w2si2/comment/j7ozpgo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
In that case, I can work through the free stuff and use my six month voucher when i hit a roadblock. In other words, I could do 80% of the site and use the voucher to finish it off.

I'm in the rabbit hole in terms of making a blog, where I should focus primarily on the cybersecurity learning. Yet I feel like they should go hand in hand, because part of the reason I made a blog is to showcase my progress.
