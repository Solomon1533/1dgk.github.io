title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate 
---
On January 25th, 2024, I started the [Google Cybersecurity Certificate](https://grow.google/intl/en_ca/certificates/cybersecurity/) program through Coursera.

I'll take notes throughout the course and post them here, beginning with the first of eight courses in the Google Cybersecurity Specialization, Foundations of Cybersecurity. 

As much as possible, I try to interpret the concepts into my own words. However, that's difficult in a course like this, which has so many definitions. At any rate, I plan to add a link to an Anki note deck for future reference.

# Foundations of Cybersecurity

## Module 1: Welcome to the exciting world of cybersecurity
Being a cybersecurity analyst is like preparing for a storm: you minimize risk and potential damage.

**Tip**: you don't have to check all the boxes (i.e., comp. sci degree); perfectionism can be an obstacle.

To recap, you should be able to speak on these topics:
- Define security
- Job responsibilities
- Core skills
- Value of security


### Definitions
**Cloud security**: The process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured and access to those assets is limited to authorized users.

**Compliance**: The process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.

**Cybersecurity**: The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

**External threat**: Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets.

**Internal threat**: A current or former employee, external vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk.

**Network security**: The practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access.

**Programming**: A process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.

**Security frameworks**: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.

**Security controls**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.

**Security posture**: An organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change.

**Threat actor**: Any person or group who presents a security risk.

## Module 2: The evolution of cybersecurity

Contents:
- Viruses
- Malware 
- Social engineering
- Digital age
- Security domains

Early attacks:
- Brain virus
- Morris worm

Later big attacks:
- LoveLetter
- Equifax breach

**Tip**: Adapting and learning new techniques is part of the job.

Why social engineering is so effective:

**Authority**: people have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.

**Intimidation**: threat actors use bullying tactics.

**Consensus / social proof**: they use others' trust to pretend they're legitimate.

**Scarcity**: they imply that goods or services are in short supply.

**Familiarity**: they exploit fake emotional relationships.

**Trust**: they build a relationship over time.

**Urgency**: they implore the victim to ack quickly.

**Tip**: During a breach, keep your cool. Stop / contain the breach, then investigate.

The eight CISSP security domains:

Important to understand.

**Security and risk management**: This domain covers the fundamental aspects of security, such as governance, compliance, ethics, business continuity, and risk assessment.

**Asset security**: This domain focuses on the identification, classification, protection, and disposal of information assets, such as data, devices, and systems.

**Security architecture and engineering**: This domain deals with the design, implementation, and evaluation of security architectures, models, principles, and controls.

**Communication and network security**: This domain addresses the security of data transmission and network infrastructure, such as protocols, components, and services.

**Identity and access management**: This domain relates to the establishment and maintenance of user identities, credentials, and access rights, such as authentication, authorization, and accountability.

**Security access and testing**: This domain involves the verification and validation of security controls, such as audits, assessments, tests, and reviews.

**Security operations**: This domain encompasses the operational aspects of security, such as incident response, investigations, monitoring, logging, and recovery.

**Software development security**: This domain pertains to the integration of security into the software development lifecycle, such as methodologies, practices, and tools.

**Tip**: Learning the history can help you understand the current state of the industry.

### Definitions

**Adversarial artificial intelligence (AI)**: A technique that manipulates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology to conduct attacks more efficiently 

**Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: A type of phishing attack where a threat actor impersonates a known source to obtain financial advantage

**Computer virus**: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software

**Cryptographic attack**: An attack that affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient

**Hacker**: Any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data

**Malware**: Software designed to harm devices or networks

**Password attack**: An attempt to access password secured devices, systems, networks, or data

**Phishing**: The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software

**Physical attack**: A security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed

**Physical social engineering**: An attack in which a threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location

**Social engineering**: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables

**Social media phishing**: A type of attack where a threat actor collects detailed information about their target on social media sites before initiating the attack

**Spear phishing**: A malicious email attack targeting a specific user or group of users, appearing to originate from a trusted source

**Supply-chain attack**: An attack that targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed

**USB baiting**: An attack in which a threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install to unknowingly infect a network

**Virus**: refer to “computer virus”

**Vishing**: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source

**Watering hole attack**: A type of attack when a threat actor compromises a website frequently visited by a specific group of users

## Module 3: Frameworks and controls
Security frameworks and controls\
Ethics

Like planning, growing, and maintaining a garden. Security is like that. You need to make continuous improvements.

First you identify your organization's critical assets and risks. Then you implement the necessary frameworks and controls.

**Security frameworks**: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.

Purpose of security frameworks: 
- protecting PII
- securing financial information
- identifying security weaknesses
- aligning security with business goals

Components of security frameworks:
- identifying and documenting security goals, e.g. align with GDPR
- setting guidelines to achieve security goals, e.g. may need to develop new policies
- implementing strong security processes, e.g. user updates or deletes data
- monitoring and communicating results, e.g. report it to management

**Security controls**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks\
E.g. track which employees are using protocols.

**CIA triad**: A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

**Confidentiality**: Only authorized users can access specific assets or data. E.g. role management.

**Integrity**: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable. E.g. encryption.

**Availability**: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

**Asset**: An item perceived as having value to an organization. E.g. an app that handles SSN's. 

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

Important to know these and how they're used. I.e., you might get questions about cybersecurity frameworks in an interview. Also, it's an important part of the analyst's job to keep informed about common frameworks, controls, and compliance regulations.
