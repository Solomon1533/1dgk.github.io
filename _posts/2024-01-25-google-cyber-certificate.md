title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate 
---
Today I started the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program through Coursera.

I'll take notes throughout the course and post them here. This page will be the main link. 

Today I went through the first part of the course, which is just an introduction. 

I haven't taken a proper course online in a while. My struggle has to do with notes. I want to keep the notes public and post them here, but how can I organize them so they're accessible and sensible?

I'll take notes by hand then polish them up a bit for the website. Easy enough. I could even put everything on one page (this one), with anchors, table of contents, etc. 

Before I go down the OneNote vs Obsidian rabbit hole, let me take a breather.
