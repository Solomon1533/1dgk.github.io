title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course 1 - Foundations of Cybersecurity
---
On January 25th, 2024, I started the [Google Cybersecurity Certificate](https://grow.google/intl/en_ca/certificates/cybersecurity/) program through Coursera.

I'll take notes throughout the course and post them here, beginning with the first of eight courses in the Google Cybersecurity Specialization, Foundations of Cybersecurity. 

As much as possible, I try to interpret the concepts into my own words. However, that's difficult in a course like this, which has so many definitions. At any rate, I plan to add a link to an Anki note deck for future reference.

## Module 2: The evolution of cybersecurity

Contents:
- Viruses
- Malware 
- Social engineering
- Digital age
- Security domains

Early attacks:
- Brain virus
- Morris worm

Later big attacks:
- LoveLetter
- Equifax breach

**Tip**: Adapting and learning new techniques is part of the job.

Why social engineering is so effective:

**Authority**: people have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.

**Intimidation**: threat actors use bullying tactics.

**Consensus / social proof**: they use others' trust to pretend they're legitimate.

**Scarcity**: they imply that goods or services are in short supply.

**Familiarity**: they exploit fake emotional relationships.

**Trust**: they build a relationship over time.

**Urgency**: they implore the victim to ack quickly.

**Tip**: During a breach, keep your cool. Stop / contain the breach, then investigate.

The eight CISSP security domains:

Important to understand.

**Security and risk management**: This domain covers the fundamental aspects of security, such as governance, compliance, ethics, business continuity, and risk assessment.

**Asset security**: This domain focuses on the identification, classification, protection, and disposal of information assets, such as data, devices, and systems.

**Security architecture and engineering**: This domain deals with the design, implementation, and evaluation of security architectures, models, principles, and controls.

**Communication and network security**: This domain addresses the security of data transmission and network infrastructure, such as protocols, components, and services.

**Identity and access management**: This domain relates to the establishment and maintenance of user identities, credentials, and access rights, such as authentication, authorization, and accountability.

**Security access and testing**: This domain involves the verification and validation of security controls, such as audits, assessments, tests, and reviews.

**Security operations**: This domain encompasses the operational aspects of security, such as incident response, investigations, monitoring, logging, and recovery.

**Software development security**: This domain pertains to the integration of security into the software development lifecycle, such as methodologies, practices, and tools.

**Tip**: Learning the history can help you understand the current state of the industry.

## Module 3: Frameworks and controls
Security frameworks and controls\
Ethics

Like planning, growing, and maintaining a garden. Security is like that. You need to make continuous improvements.

First you identify your organization's critical assets and risks. Then you implement the necessary frameworks and controls.

**Security frameworks**: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.

Purpose of security frameworks: 
- protecting PII
- securing financial information
- identifying security weaknesses
- aligning security with business goals

Components of security frameworks:
- identifying and documenting security goals, e.g. align with GDPR
- setting guidelines to achieve security goals, e.g. may need to develop new policies
- implementing strong security processes, e.g. user updates or deletes data
- monitoring and communicating results, e.g. report it to management

**Security controls**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks\
E.g. track which employees are using protocols.

**CIA triad**: A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

**Confidentiality**: Only authorized users can access specific assets or data. E.g. role management.

**Integrity**: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable. E.g. encryption.

**Availability**: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

**Asset**: An item perceived as having value to an organization. E.g. an app that handles SSN's. 

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

Important to know these and how they're used. I.e., you might get questions about cybersecurity frameworks in an interview. Also, it's an important part of the analyst's job to keep informed about common frameworks, controls, and compliance regulations. 

Ethics: right or wrong answer isn't always clear. Remain unbiased. Security professionals often have greater access to data, so they have a higher obligation to follow the appropriate guidelines.

**Security ethics**: Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional. 

Ethical principles
- Confidentiality. E.g. you might see PII. It's up to you too keep that confidential and safe. 
- Privacy protection. E.g. a manager asks you for someone else's phone number. That would be unethical. 
- Law. E.g. data that should never be left unsupervised. 

### More definitions

**Hackivist**: A person who uses hacking to achieve a political goal.

**Privacy protection**: The act of safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use. 

**Security architecture**: A type of security design composed of multiple components, such as tools and processes, that are used to protect an organization from risks and external threats.

**Security governance**: Practices that help support, define, and direct security efforts of an organization. 

## Module 4: Important cybersecurity tools

- SIEM tools (e.g. Splunk, Chronicle)
- Playbooks
- Network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers)
- Linux operating system
- Programming languages - Python, SQL

**Log**: A record of events that occur within a organization's systems. E.g. each time an employee signs into their computer.

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool**: An application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. (*Pronounce it 'sim' or 'seem'.*)

E.g. Splunk Enterprise or Google Chronicle 

**Playbook**: A manual that provides details about any operational action.

**Network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer)**: A tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network.

E.g. tcpdump or Wireshark

**Programming**: Used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.

**Structured Query Language (SQL)**: A programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.

**Database**: An organized collection of information or data.

**Python**: Used to perform tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming, and that require a high level of detail and accuracy. 

Every toolkit might be different, but most of the functions are the same. E.g., who cares what colour a bucket is, if its purpose is to collect or transport water.

Ideas for projects to add to your portfolio (in my case, this website):
- Drafting a professional statement
- Conducting a security audit
- Analyzing network structure and security
- Using Linux commands to manage file permissions
- Applying filters to SQL queries
- Identifying vulnerabilities for a small business
- Documenting incidents with an incident handler’s journal 
- Importing and parsing a text file in a security-related scenario
- Creating or revising a resume

More on these later.
