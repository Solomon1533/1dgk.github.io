A headline on HackerNews caught my eye. It's about intermittent fasting. Down the rabbit hole I went. 

The [Economist article](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2023/09/25/eating-fewer-calories-can-ward-off-ageing).

The big question is whether I can have cream in my coffee. 

For now, my aim is to do the 16/8 setup, where you don't eat for 16 hours, then eat within the 8 hour window. In my case, it's as simple as not eating anything until noon, then don't eat anything after 8pm.

Up next is to dig into the Mediterranean diet. I looked into it in early 2023, but quickly forgot about it.
