After yet another email to describe the increased price of a subscription service, I decided to go the self host route. 

I'll set this up on an old laptop, then look into a proper setup once I have everything ironed out. 

**OS**
- Ubuntu

**Apps**
- Actual Budget - since YNAB seems to increase their prices on a yearly basis
