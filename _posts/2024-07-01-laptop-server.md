title: DGK Self Hosted - The Jump Off
---
After yet another email to describe the increased price of a subscription service, I decided to self host a few things. 

For this project, I'll use an old laptop that is kicking around. 

**OS**
- Ubuntu Server

**Apps**
- Actual Budget - since YNAB seems to increase their prices on a yearly basis
- Arr suite
- Overseerr
- [Calibre / Readarr](https://academy.pointtosource.com/containers/ebooks-calibre-readarr/)

**OS Install**
- Grab a USB stick
- Download YunoHost iso
- Download Balena Etcher
- Flash the iso to the USB
- Boot the laptop from USB
- Install YunoHost
