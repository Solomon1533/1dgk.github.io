title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course 7 - Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python
---
This is the seventh course of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course on Coursera. Again it's a mix of my notes and definitions from the course.

[Here is a link to my main page for the course.](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/24/gcc-course-index.html)

**Course 7 Overview**
- Basic programming concepts in Python
- Writing effective Python code
- Working with strings and lists
- Putting Python into practice

## Module 1: Introduction to Python
- Best for automating short, simple tasks, e.g., sort through event logs
- Resembles human language
- Less code
- Easy to read
- Standard guidelines
- Online support
- Built-in code

**Examples of how Python is used in cybersecurity**
- Log analysis
- Malware analysis
- Access control list management
- Intrusion detection
- Compliance checks
- Network scanning

**Create a basic Python script**
- Good to start with a # comment

```py
print("Hello World")
```

**Data types in Python**
- String data - letters, symbols, spaces. Can't be used for calculations. 
- Float data - numbers with a decimal point.
- Integer data - numbers without decimal points.
- Boolean
- Lists

```py
# Calculate numbers with print
print(1+1)
```




## Module 2: Write effective Python code

## Module 3: Work with strings and lists

## Module 4: Python in practice
