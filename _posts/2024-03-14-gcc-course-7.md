title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course 7 - Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python
---
This is the seventh course of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course on Coursera. Again it's a mix of my notes and definitions from the course.

[Here is a link to my main page for the course.](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/24/gcc-course-index.html)

**Course 7 Overview**
- Basic programming concepts in Python
- Writing effective Python code
- Working with strings and lists
- Putting Python into practice

## Module 1: Introduction to Python
- Best for automating short, simple tasks, e.g., sort through event logs
- Resembles human language
- Less code
- Easy to read
- Standard guidelines
- Online support
- Built-in code

**Examples of how Python is used in cybersecurity**
- Log analysis
- Malware analysis
- Access control list management
- Intrusion detection
- Compliance checks
- Network scanning

**Create a basic Python script**
- Good to start with a # comment

```py
print("Hello World")
```

**Data types in Python**
- String data - letters, symbols, spaces. Can't be used for calculations. 
- Float data - numbers with a decimal point.
- Integer data - numbers without decimal points.
- Boolean
- Lists

```py
# Calculate numbers with print
print(1+1)
```

**Work with variables in Python**
- A container that stores data
- Creating one is often called assignment
- Using them is called 'calling' them
- Often used to simplify or clean code, or to use long strings without having to type them all out
- Important to keep track of data types 

**Conditional statements in Python**
- Automation is done with conditional statements
- Starts with `if`


```py
# Create a conditional

operating_system = "OS 3"
if operating_system == "OS 2":
    print("Updates needed")
else:
    print("No updates needed")
```

**For loops**
- An iterative statement

```py
for i in [1,2,3,4]:
    print(i)
```

`range(0,10)`

**While loops**
```py
# Create a while loop

max_devices = 5
i = 1

while i < max_devices:
    print("User can still connect to additional devices")
    i = i + 1
print("User has reached maximum number of connected devices")
```

Analysts need to be familiar with iterative statements like `for`, `while`, etc.
