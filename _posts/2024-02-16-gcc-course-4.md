title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course 4 - Tools of the Trade - Linux and SQL
---
This is the fourth course of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course on Coursera. Again it's a mix of my notes and definitions from the course.

My notes tail off here because the material is so familiar. 

[Here is a link to my main page for the course.](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/24/gcc-course-index.html)

**Course 4 Overview**
- OS
- Linux
- SQL

## Module 1: Intro to operating systems
Power button -> BIOS / UEFI -> Bootloader -> OS

User -> Application -> OS -> Hardware

CLI is like making a meal from scratch. GUI is like ordering food from a restaurant. 

## Module 2: The Linux operating system
User, that's you.

Shell, the CLI.

FHS.

Kernel: communicates with hardware. Allocates resources. Manages processes and memory. Most important component of the Linux OS.

Shout out Kali. They say Kali should be used on a VM. 

apt list --installed 

The shell helps humans and computers communicate with each other. It is the command-line interpreter and helps humans communicate with the operating system through the command line.

echo hello

After a user types a command into the shell, the shell can return either standard output or standard error. Standard output is information returned by the OS through the shell. Standard error contains error messages returned by the OS through the shell.

expr 3500 * 12

## Module 3: Linux commands in the Bash shell
Configure users and groups. 

Bash is the default for most distros.

Dollar sign means enter a command. 

Argument is information needed by a command. 

Root. Think trees. Root directory is a single slash.

```sh
man hier
```

head, tail, less.

grep . e.g. grep OS updates.txt

Piping. e.g. ls /home/reports | grep users

read write execute rwx

user group other 

d [directory] rwx [permission for user] rwx [permission for group] rwx [permission for other]

World writable means anyone can edit it. 

Change permissions with chmod

u / g / o

chmod g+w,o-r access.txt

Reading permissions

In Linux, permissions are represented with a 10-character string. Permissions include:

    read: for files, this is the ability to read the file contents; for directories, this is the ability to read all contents in the directory including both files and subdirectories

    write: for files, this is the ability to make modifications on the file contents; for directories, this is the ability to create new files in the directory

    execute: for files, this is the ability to execute the file if itâ€™s a program; for directories, this is the ability to enter the directory and access its files

These permissions are given to these types of owners:

    user: the owner of the file

    group: a larger group that the owner is a part of

    other: all other users on the system

## Module 4: Databases and SQL
