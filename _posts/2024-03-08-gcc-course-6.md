---
This is the sixth course of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course on Coursera. Again it's a mix of my notes and definitions from the course.

[Here is a link to my main page for the course.](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/24/gcc-course-index.html)

**Course 6 Overview**
- Incident response lifecycle
- Monitor and analyze network traffic
- Processes and procedures
- Interpret logs and alerts

## Module 1: Introduction to detection and incident response

## Module 2: Network monitoring and analysis

**Components of a packet**
1. Header
2. Payload
3. Footer

Packet sniffers, e.g. tcpdump, Wireshark.

**Packet capture (PCAP)**: a file containing data packets intercepted from an interface or network. 

**TCP/IP Model**
Application
Transport
***Internet***
Network Access

IPv4 and IPv6 have different but similar fields.

Options (optional)

## Module 3: Incident investigation and response
- Investigate and verify an incident
- Plans and processes behind incident response
- Post-incident actions

Final reports 

Playbooks again

## Module 4: Network traffic and logs using IDS and SIEM tools
- Logs, logs, logs
- Interpret signatures
- Search in SIEM tools

**Importance of logs**
- How we detect unusual events
- What, where, and when an event occurred on a network
    - Date, time, location, action, names
- Can build a timeline with log analysis

**Log types**
- Network
- System
- Application
- Security
- Authentication

```Login Event [2022/11/16 05:45:15.892673] auth_performer.cc:470 User1 Authenticated successfully from device1 (192.168.1.2)```

Precision with logs is key. Find the goldilocks zone--not too much, not too little.

**Logs contain**
- Timestamps
- System characteristics
- Action

**Commonly used log formats**
- Syslog
- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
    - Simple, easily readable
- eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
- Comma Separated Values (CSV)
