title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course 6 - Sound the Alarm - Detection and Response
---
This is the sixth course of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course on Coursera. Again it's a mix of my notes and definitions from the course.

[Here is a link to my main page for the course.](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/24/gcc-course-index.html)

**Course 6 Overview**
- Incident response lifecycle
- Monitor and analyze network traffic
- Processes and procedures
- Interpret logs and alerts

## Module 1: Introduction to detection and incident response

## Module 2: Network monitoring and analysis

**Components of a packet**
1. Header
2. Payload
3. Footer

Packet sniffers, e.g. tcpdump, Wireshark.

**Packet capture (PCAP)**: a file containing data packets intercepted from an interface or network. 

**TCP/IP Model**
Application
Transport
***Internet***
Network Access

IPv4 and IPv6 have different but similar fields.

Version
IHL 
ToS
Total Length

Identification
Flags
Fragment Offset

Time To Live
Protocol
Header Checksum

Source Address

Destination Address

Options (optional)

## Module 3: Incident investigation and response
- Investigate and verify an incident
- Plans and processes behind incident response
- Post-incident actions

Final reports 

Playbooks again

## Module 4: Network traffic and logs using IDS and SIEM tools
- Logs, logs, logs
- Interpret signatures
- Search in SIEM tools

**Importance of logs**
- How we detect unusual events
- What, where, and when an event occurred on a network
    - Date, time, location, action, names
- Can build a timeline with log analysis

**Log types**
- Network
- System
- Application
- Security
- Authentication

```Login Event [2022/11/16 05:45:15.892673] auth_performer.cc:470 User1 Authenticated successfully from device1 (192.168.1.2)```

Precision with logs is key. Find the goldilocks zone--not too much, not too little.

**Logs contain**
- Timestamps
- System characteristics
- Action

**Commonly used log formats**
- Syslog
- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
    - Simple, easily readable
- eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
    - Uses tags
- Comma Separated Values (CSV)

Host-based vs network-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). Combine them both to provide layered security.

**Signature analysis** is a detection method that is used to find events of interest. Lowers the rate of false positives; however, they can be evaded and require updates.

**Components of a detection signature**
1. Action - alert, pass, or reject
2. Header - source and dest IPs, ports, etc
3. Rule options - msg, rev, etc.

**Hands-on with Suricata**
- Can be used as an IDS, IPS, or NSM
