title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate 
---
In late January 2024, I started the [Google Cybersecurity Certificate](https://grow.google/intl/en_ca/certificates/cybersecurity/) program through Coursera.

I took notes throughout the course and posted them here, starting with the first of eight courses in the Google Cybersecurity Specialization, Foundations of Cybersecurity. 

As much as possible, I tried to interpret the concepts into my own words. However, that's difficult in a course like this, which has so many definitions.

[Course 2: Play It Safe: Manage Cybersecurity Risks](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/28/gcc-course-2.html)
- [Conducting a Security Audit](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/02/02/gcc-course-2-sec-audit.html) - My submission of an internal security audit.

[Course 3: Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security](tbd)
