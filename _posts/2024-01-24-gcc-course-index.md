title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate 
---
In late January 2024, I started the [Google Cybersecurity Certificate](https://grow.google/intl/en_ca/certificates/cybersecurity/) program through Coursera.

I took notes throughout the course and posted them here, starting with the first of eight courses in the Google Cybersecurity Specialization, Foundations of Cybersecurity. 

As much as possible, I tried to interpret the concepts into my own words. However, that's difficult in a course like this, which has so many definitions.
