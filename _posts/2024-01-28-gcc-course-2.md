title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course 2 - Play It Safe - Manage Security Risks
---
This is the second course of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course on Coursera. Again it's a mix of my notes and definitions from the course.

[Here is a link to my notes from the first course.](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/25/google-cyber-certificate.html)

Course 2 Overview
- CISSP's eight security domains
- Security frameworks and controls
- Basic security tools
- Use playbooks to respond to incidents

## Module 1: Security domains

Eight CISSP domains. Security teams use them to organize daily task and identify gaps in security. **So it's very important to know and understand the domains.**

**Security posture**: An organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data, and react to change.

**Domain 1: Security and risk management**: Focused on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations. 

E.g. infosec playbooks. Includes cloud security and infrastructure security.

**Risk mitigation**: The process of having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.

**Business continuity**: An organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.

**Domain 2: Asset Security**: Focused on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

E.g. you might have to oversee the destruction of data. Also includes things like security impact analysis, recovery plans, etc.

**Domain 3: Security architecture and engineering**: Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.

**Shared responsibility**: All individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security. 

Includes concepts like zero trust, defense in depth, least privilege, etc.

**Domain 4: Communication and network security**: Focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. 

E.g. employees working remotely at a public cafe.

**Domain 5: Identity and access management (IAM)**: Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets.

Components of IAM
- Identification (user verifies who they are)
- Authentication (verification process)
- Authorization (id confirmed)
- Accountability (e.g. login attempts)

Least privilege: granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task. 

**Domain 6: Security assessment and testing**: Focused on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

Essentially it's testing to see if current controls work, what can be improved, etc. E.g. MFA. Pen testing as well.

**Domain 7: Security operations**: Focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. E.g. forensic investigations.

Training and awareness, SIEM tools, log management, playbooks, etc.

**Domain 8: Software development security**: Focused on using secure coding practices. E.g. secure design all the way through, including pen testing, so that security is embedded.
