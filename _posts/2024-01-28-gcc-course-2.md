title: Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course 2 - Play It Safe - Manage Security Risks
---
This is the second course of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course on Coursera. Again it's a mix of my notes and definitions from the course.

[Here is a link to my notes from the first course.](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/25/google-cyber-certificate.html)

**Course 2 Overview**
- CISSP's eight security domains
- Security frameworks and controls
- Basic security tools
- Use playbooks to respond to incidents

## Module 1: Security domains

### More on the eight CISSP security domains

Eight CISSP domains. Security teams use them to organize daily task and identify gaps in security. **So it's very important to know and understand the domains.**

**Security posture**: An organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data, and react to change.

**Domain 1: Security and risk management**: Focused on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations. 

E.g. infosec playbooks. Includes cloud security and infrastructure security.

**Risk mitigation**: The process of having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.

**Business continuity**: An organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.

**Domain 2: Asset Security**: Focused on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

E.g. you might have to oversee the destruction of data. Also includes things like security impact analysis, recovery plans, etc.

**Domain 3: Security architecture and engineering**: Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.

**Shared responsibility**: All individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security. 

Includes concepts like zero trust, defense in depth, least privilege, etc.

**Domain 4: Communication and network security**: Focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. 

E.g. employees working remotely at a public cafe.

**Domain 5: Identity and access management (IAM)**: Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets.

**Components of IAM**
- Identification (user verifies who they are)
- Authentication (verification process)
- Authorization (id confirmed)
- Accountability (e.g. login attempts)

Least privilege: granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task. 

**Domain 6: Security assessment and testing**: Focused on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

Essentially it's testing to see if current controls work, what can be improved, etc. E.g. MFA. Pen testing as well.

**Domain 7: Security operations**: Focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. E.g. forensic investigations.

Training and awareness, SIEM tools, log management, playbooks, etc.

**Domain 8: Software development security**: Focused on using secure coding practices. E.g. secure design all the way through, including pen testing, so that security is embedded. 

**Tip**: Be like a t-shape. Tech skills and soft skills. Also analysis skills. You work with people and processes for the most part. Don't be discouraged if they're something you're not great at. 

**Another tip**: Get real familiar with the eight security domains. You'll need to be cozy with these concepts.

### Threats, risks, and vulnerabilities

**Threat**: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

**Social engineering**: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. E.g. phishing.

**Risk**: Anything that can impact the confidentiality integrity, or availability of an asset. I.e. the likelihood of a threat occurring. 

**Low-risk asset**: Information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.

**Medium-risk asset**: Information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations. 

**High-risk asset**: Information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation. E.g. leaked PII, SPII, or IP.

**Vulnerability**: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat. Note: vulnerability + risk = threat. People can be a vulnerability. 

**Tip**: Educating people on security best practices is part of the job. 

### Impacts of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities

**Ransomware**: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.

**Layers of the web**
- Surface web
    - Most people use it. Web browser.
- Deep web
    - Usually requires authorization to access it. E.g. an organization's intranet.
- Dark web
    - Can only be accessed by using special software. Preferred by criminals.

**Key impacts**
- Financial
    - Interrupted services, costs to return to business
- Identity theft
    - Storing any kind of sensitive data is a risk for an organization. 
- Reputation
    - When a company gets pwned, people will look for alternatives. 

### NIST's Risk Management Framework (RMF)

Important to be familiar with it. 

**RMF**
- Prepare
    - Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs.
- Categorize
    - Used to develop risk management processes and tasks.
- Select
    - Choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization. E.g. keeping a playbook up to date. 
- Implement
    - Implement security and privacy plans for the organization. E.g. employees constantly need password resets.
- Assess
    - Determine if established controls are implemented correctly. E.g. identify potential weaknesses.
- Authorize
    - Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization. E.g. generating reports.
- Monitor
    - Be aware of how systems are operating. E.g. knowing how the current systems meet the security goals. 

**Tip**: You might not be in charge of setting up the framework, but it's good to be aware of it in your day-to-day.

**Recap**
- CISSP's eight security domains
- Threats, risks, and vulnerabilities
- Layers of the web
- NIST RMF
