The CompTIA A+ certification

I use the [Sybex exam guide by Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-ca/CompTIA+A%2B+Complete+Deluxe+Study+Guide+with+Online+Labs%3A+Core+1+Exam+220-1101+and+Core+2+Exam+220-1102%2C+5th+Edition-p-9781119863212)


At the beginning of the book, there is an assessment test for each exam. Here are my results:
1101: 53%
1102: 50%

Safe to say I have a lot to learn.
