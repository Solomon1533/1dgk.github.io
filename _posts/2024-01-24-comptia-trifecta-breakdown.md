title: CompTIA Trifecta Cost Breakdown 
---
This year I plan to get three CompTIA certifications, commonly known as the trifecta: A+, Network+, and Security+.

Following is a cost breakdown for the 'Basic Bundle' for each cert. This comes with an extra attempt at the exam.

- A+ 1101: $360
- A+ 1102: $360
- Network+: $462
- Security+: $565
    - Total: $1,747 USD or $2,362 CAD

I would likely buy a physical copy of a good textbook for each certification. Add another $300 and it's still under $3,000 CAD for all three certifications.
