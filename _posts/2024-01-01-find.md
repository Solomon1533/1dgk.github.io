The following are answers to a short assignment from the Linux basics section of the Computing Fundamentals course on [Roppers](https://www.roppers.org/).

1. I used this command to find all the html files in my directory, that are owned by me and are 12kb in size:
```sh
$ find . -type f -name "*.html" -user dgk -size 12
```

2. To find all the hidden files in a directory, I used the following command:
```sh
$ find . -type f -name ".*"
```
