Inspired by [this post](https://tryhackme.com/r/resources/blog/free_path), I'll work through each room and provide explanations along the way.

### Level 1 - Getting Started

Before getting started with challenges and CTFs (Capture the Flags), we recommend easing in with the following training:
- [x] Tutorial - Learn how to use a TryHackMe room to start your upskilling in cyber security
- [x] [Intro to Offensive Security](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtooffensivesecurity) - Hack your first website (legally in a safe environment) and experience an ethical hacker's job
    - [See my walkthrough](/2024-01-14-tryhackme-intro-offsec.md)
- [x] [Introduction to Offensive Pentesting](https://tryhackme.com/module/introduction-to-offensive-pentesting) - Understand what a penetration test involves, including testing techniques and methodologies every pentester should know
- [ ] [Linux Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals) - Learn how to use the Linux operating system, a critical skill in cyber security
- [ ] [OhSINT](https://tryhackme.com/room/ohsint) - Use open-source intelligence to solve this challenge!

### Level 2 - Tooling

The most important thing in a pentester's toolbox is tooling. At this level, you’ll learn the absolute minimum of the necessary tools to become a better hacker!

- [ ]Nmap Live Host Discovery - Learn how to use Nmap to discover live hosts using ARP scan, ICMP scan, and TCP/UDP ping scan

Again, here are some more introductory CTFs. These are a little more complex, but with your new knowledge of tools, you should smash them in no time! Don't worry if you can't, that's what hacking is all about – trying harder until you can no longer try and then learning from what you couldn't do.
