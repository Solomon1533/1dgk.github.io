Today I learned that you can run a lightweight instance of VSCode in your browser. My whole website is made of light markdown files, so it's perfect for making edits when I'm away from my regular rigs.

Previously I would log into my GitHub account and edit the raw files in my repository (e.g., from my phone). 

Now I can make edits from anywhere, using the browser, almost exactly like I would in the native VSCode desktop app. Love it!
