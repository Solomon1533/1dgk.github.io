This week I started the Google Cybersecurity Certificate course on Coursera. You can follow my progress starting with [this page](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/25/google-cyber-certificate.html).

Cool things I found around the web this week:
- [Full Stack LLM Bootcamp](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/llm-bootcamp/) - a free course for building LLM-powered apps
- David Bombal has an [interesting conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acWkkLaEsrU) with Andy Yen 
- [BARTKIRA](http://www.bartkira.com/) - a fan-made mashup of The Simpson and Akira
- Take a virtual tour through the [Museum of Failure](https://collection.museumoffailure.com/)

I played around with the 'arr' suite of apps. But I struggled to make them all work through Docker containers. More to follow on that quest.

I'm on the second season of Banshee. Good times.
