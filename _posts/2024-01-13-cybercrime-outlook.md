I came across [this article](https://www.statista.com/chart/28878/expected-cost-of-cybercrime-until-2027/) that predicts cybercrime costs to surge from $8 trillion to over $20 trillion per year by 2027. 

Those are ridiculous numbers.

Some of these stats seems to be backed up. See a report by [Cyber Ventures](https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/2023-official-cybercrime-report.)
