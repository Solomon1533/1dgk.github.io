# TO DO
- Work through THM free rooms - follow my journey here
- YNAB alternative - Actual Budget
- iCloud / OneDrive / Photos alternative
    - Selfhosted / homelab
- Use Ollama
- Lower internet plan
    - Current plan is with Rogers - $140 a month (taxes incl.). Term ends 2025-08-18. Early termination fee is roughly $350, which is ridiculous. 
    - Netcrawler 100Mbs plan - $50 a month (taxes incl.). No contract. 
    - From now to the termination date is roughly 19 months.
    - 19 months * $140 = $2,660 to stay with Rogers 
    - 19 months * $50 = $950 to switch to Netcrawler
    - Gross saved by the switch: $1,710
    - Less the potential $410 nonsensical cancellation fee
    - Total saved by the switch: ***$1,300***
    - All told, it's an easy call.
- Water heater rental - it's a scam, I know - don't ask
