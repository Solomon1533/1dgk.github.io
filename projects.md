# Home Lab / Self Host
- Set up a NAS with the following:
    - [AdGuard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html) - adblocker
    - [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/athome/) - cloud storage
    - [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) - media server
    - [Immich](https://immich.app/) - photo server
    - [Maybe](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe) - personal finance

# TO DO
- Work through THM free rooms - follow my journey here
- YNAB alternative - Actual Budget
- iCloud / OneDrive / Photos alternative
    - Selfhosted / homelab
    - Start with getting rid of cloud services I currently pay for
        - Apple Family plan $35/mth, YNAB $12/mth, OneDrive Family $7/mth
        - Get rid of cloud services from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Dropbox
        - The main one to start with is photos, as they take up the most space in our cloud storage.
    - My plan is to test these self hosted solutions on my local (and old) HDD. If all goes well, I'll set up my own server with a NAS.
- Use Ollama
- Make a post for making tea. Single cup, pot of tea, etc. 
- List my rigs - see [this post](_posts/2024-01-19-my-rigs.md).
