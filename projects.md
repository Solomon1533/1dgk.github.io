# TO DO
- Work through THM free rooms - follow my journey here
- YNAB alternative - Actual Budget
- iCloud / OneDrive / Photos alternative
    - Selfhosted / homelab
    - Start with getting rid of cloud services I currently pay for
        - Apple Family plan $35/mth, YNAB $12/mth, OneDrive Family $7/mth
        - Get rid of cloud services from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Dropbox
        - The main one to start with is photos, as they take up the most space in our cloud storage.
    - My plan is to test these self hosted solutions on my local (and old) HDD. If all goes well, I'll set up my own server with a NAS.
- Use Ollama
- Make a post for making tea. Single cup, pot of tea, etc. 
- Lower internet plan
    - Current plan is with Rogers - $140 a month (taxes incl.). Term ends 2025-08-18. Early termination fee is roughly $350, which is ridiculous. 
        - Called and threatened to leave. Now my bill is about $70 a month (taxes incl.)
- Water heater rental - it's a scam, I know - don't ask
