## 2024 - Doing
- [Stanford Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/)
    - [My Code in Place page](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/04/10/code-in-place-index.html)
- [MITx 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2018/home)
    - [Textbook](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AJounr3vgj6XhJU3?e=TDtskQ)
- Math - Precalculus - essentially I need to get caught back up to university-level calculus.
    - [OSSU has an interesting set of links](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites) to Khan Academy tests. That way, you can challenge yourself and get an idea of where you stand with each topic.
        - Arithmetics - tested 3 MAY
        - Basic Geometry - tested 4 MAY
        - Pre-algebra
        - Integrated Math 1
        - Integrated Math 2
        - Integrated Math 3

    - [CK-12 - Precalculus](https://flexbooks.ck12.org/cbook/ck-12-precalculus-concepts-2.0/)
    - [OpenStax - Precalculus](https://openstax.org/details/books/precalculus-2e)
    - [Calculus for Beginners](https://math.mit.edu/~djk/calculus_beginners/index.html) - a resource by Daniel Kleitman. A bit dated, but dumbs things down for me. 

## 2024 - Done
- [Google Cybersecurity Certification](https://grow.google/certificates/cybersecurity/)
    - [My notes](https://1dgk.github.io/2024/01/24/gcc-course-index.html)
