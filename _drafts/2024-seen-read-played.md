This is where I'll put a draft of everything I read, watched, or played in 2024.

I learned this idea from a NYT Book Review podcast interview with Stephen Soderbergh. Here is a [link to his website](https://extension765.com/blogs/soderblog/seen-read-2023)

All caps, bold: **MOVIE**

All caps, bold, asterisk: **SHORT***

All caps: TV SERIES

Italics: _Book_

Quotation marks: “Play”

Italics, quotation marks: “_Short Story”_

For TV series, put the number of episodes I watched in brackets.
