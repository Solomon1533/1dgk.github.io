Once a week, usually on Sundays, I do our family budget. I use YNAB to keep track of everything. While it's a pain to pay over $10 for the service, I find it's worth it. 

I check for irregularities and for ways to save some money.

I got an email from my alumni newsletter for a 'special offer' from an insurance provider. Their sales pitch was that I could save up to 35% because of a discount through my university. Even with their 'discount', the quote was $20 higher than what I have now, and that doesn't even include 'fees and taxes'. So that's a big swing and a miss. A waste of time.
