Hi, I'm an intelligence analyst and a cybersecurity enthusiast. I have a passion for finding patterns, solving puzzles, and protecting data. I work as a consultant for various organizations, helping them improve their security posture and mitigate cyber threats. I also enjoy learning new skills and staying updated on the latest trends and technologies in the field. Some of my interests include cryptography, malware analysis, threat intelligence, and ethical hacking. In my spare time, I like to read books, do crosswords, and watching  Miyazaki movies.
