These are random bits.

One idea is to put all the books I read here, with a link to a quick review. 

For example, I just read the graphic novel version of 1984 by George Orwell, drawn by Fido Nesti.

I'll make a test review post and link to it right here.

Then I'll add it to a list of books that I've read.
